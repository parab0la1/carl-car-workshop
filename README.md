## Carls car workshop

A first feel for a Spring boot application, Carl car workshop was the final exam of the course  called: Patterns, databases and architecture

Mainly for the course only the java backend was of importance. The project clearly shows that I was a freshmen in javascript and it was of little importance for
the final project.


## Techniques and frameworks used

Spring, Maven, Java, Mysql, MVC, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS
